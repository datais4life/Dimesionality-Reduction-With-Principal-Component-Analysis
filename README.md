# Dimesionality-Reduction-With-Principal-Component-Analysis
<p> A telecommunications company is trying to better understand their customer base and the reason(s) they chose to churn from the provider. The data set of customer information is too big and will need to be reduced to determine the attributes associated with churning customers. The dimensionality reduction method of principal component analysis (PCA) will be utilized to reduce the size of the data set. This analysis will answer the question of: What attributes best describe the customers of the provider? The goal of this research is to reduce the data set of noise and keep only those attributes that best define the customer. Determining the variables that effect the customer the greatest will allow the executives the ability to make changes impacting those variables. </p>
